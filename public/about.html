<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>
  Hi there! I am a tech-head, studying computer engineering, who is majoring in web development as a hobby. For me tech is always a playground where I can use my engineering knowledge with the creative problem-solving approach to create intuitive and effective digital experiences.  

  Over the years, I've become pretty good at figuring out how different things actually work, whether it's troubleshooting a complicated circuit or reprogramming a code to enhance a seamless operation. My education in web development began as a result of my inquisitiveness and the will to come up with user-friendly solutions that combine functionality and aesthetics.  
  
  Apart from coding or messing around with tech, I enjoy being up to date with the latest industry trends, accumulating my skills, and fantasizing creative projects that will stretch the limits of technology. I'm not only making websites but I'm also a designer of experiences that can affect the users.</p>

  When it comes to websites for companies and brands, my goal is to produce not only solutions that have a nice appearance but also be a real solution to the problems. I have problem-selling skills together with a beady eye for detail to create websites that are not merely attractive but also actively engaging, fast, and users’ scale. My computer engineering background gives me a technical foundation that allows me to create websites that work perfectly under the hood without suspending the performance.  
  The sites have been prepared to fit the brand and convey the message that the brand wants people to know about it, either by optimizing internal computing processes for better performance, flexing the design to various devices, or using the most recent technology. I’m a perfectionist. With every project, I want to create something that people will feel happy to look at and able to interact with.

  Ideally, I would like to use my engineering background and always evolving  web development skills to create and to put into effect revolutionary approaches to the problems of the world. I am truly a fan of taking on issues directly, be it a sports competition, a chess game, or even finding ways to be creative in my personal life.
  When I'm away from the computer, I'm located in this highly electrified world which keeps on reshaping the future and I keep myself informed of these developments. I like to do exploratory projects that make me go out of my zone, such as developing interactive web apps or thinking of new possibilities to make technology more user-friendly and widely accessible to all people.
  I am enthusiastic about cooperative ventures, and I display a high delight in conversing with kindred spirits, with whom we share ideas and carry provocative thoughts into realizing fast-oriented goals for the industry. Let's combine our talents to create something magnificent and spectacular, either a new digital space or a truly innovative product. If it's ok by you, Iwould really love for us to connect and create something amazing together!
